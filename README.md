Hey, people call me Jack 👨‍💻! I am a student, computer engineer, developer, maker, and sometimes designer 👀. Currently, I am getting a Computer Engineering (AI curriculum ✨) M.Sc. degree at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy 🇮🇹). Check out my last projects on [my website 🌵](https://jacksalici.com) and please give me a slice of Margherita pizza 🍕.
