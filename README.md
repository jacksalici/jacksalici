I am studying **computer engineering** at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and **visual design** on my own becouse if robot will conquest this planet at least they should be gorgeous. 

### Welcome to the *never_finished_projects*** land üçï* 
There are a pair of themes for some websites (both static and Wordpress) and a bunch of exercise for the University courses.
I'm going to create some interesting bot but I never find the time to do that.
I'm going to create some sexy app and upload them on [@overloadedllama](https://github.com/overloadedllama/).
