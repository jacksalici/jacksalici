# Hi there, people call me Jack! ðŸŒµ

I'm getting my computer engineering MSc degree at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, and teaching myself design because, hey, if robots are taking over, might as well make them cute, right? 

Check out my last projects at [jacksalici.com](https://jacksalici.com) and remember that if you want to make me happy, please give me a slice of Margherita pizza.
