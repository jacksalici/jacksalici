I am studying **computer engineering** at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and **visual design** on my own.
I'm based near Modena, Italy.

### Welcome to the *never_finished_projects*** land üçï* 
At your left you will find a pair of themes for some websites (both static and Wordpress). At your right you might see some exercise for the University courses. I'm going to create some bot but I never find the time to do that. I'm going to create some sexy app and upload them on [@overloadedllama](https://github.com/overloadedllama/).

###### *In case that you  had not catch it yet, I like pizza and cactus. **Also this page is not finished yet.
